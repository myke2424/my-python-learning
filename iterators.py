# After that, the loop repeatedly calls the iterator objectâ€™s __next__ method to retrieve values from it.

# A simply way of expressing aboves classes is the following:

# Now lets actually define an iterator that isn't an infinite loop.
# Iterators use exceptions to structure control flow.
# To signal the end of iteration, a Python iterator simply raises the built-in StopIteration exception.
# Iterators can't be reset, you'll need to initialise a new interator object

    print(item)  # This only prints 3 times
